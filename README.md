Telegram File Sharing Bot written in PHP

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set up Webhook

To enable communication between your Telegram File Sharing Bot and the Telegram servers, you need to set up a webhook. Follow the steps below:

- Obtain a valid SSL certificate for your server. Telegram requires a secure connection (HTTPS) for webhooks.
- Set the webhook URL using the Bot API. Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token.

  ```bash
  https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://your-domain.com/path/to/your/webhook.php
  ```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Ensure you have the following environment variables set. These are essential for the proper functioning of the bot.

- `tk`: Your Telegram bot token.
- `chn`: The channel where the bot will store files.
- `admin1`: The Telegram user ID of the first admin.
- `admin2`: The Telegram user ID of the second admin.

Example:

```php
$tkn = getenv('tk');
$chn = getenv('chn');
$admin1 = getenv('admin1');
$admin2 = getenv('admin2');
```

### 3. Bot Usage

Your Telegram File Sharing Bot is now ready to use! You can share files in the specified channel, and the configured admins will have control over the bot.

## Disclaimer

Ensure you handle sensitive information, such as bot tokens and user IDs, securely. Follow best practices for bot development and adhere to Telegram's policies.

Happy botting!
